## about us
> sideloading.org is aimed to be professional and fair towards all users and developers, down to sharing other developers work as free advertising to making sure sideloading is easy and convenient to you.
> we have pretty much got everything covered, we have a wide variety of resources, such as a signer, repository for IPA's and even a certificate api. all of this is made possible due to the 6 active devs trying to bring you the best experience possible
## TLDR
- SIGNER (bulk signing, any file size)
- IPA REPO (multiple repos all in one place)
- Our very own IPA (Gateway IN-DEV)
- Certificates api (shows newest cert and old revoked certs
## Extra
> did we mention we sell extremely cheap certs? no? too bad! buy a fresh certificate for as little as $7
